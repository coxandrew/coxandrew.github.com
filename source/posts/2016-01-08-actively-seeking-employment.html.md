title: Actively seeking employment
---

For the first time since I graduated college in 2001, I am actively looking for a new job. This has given me a rare opportunity to be more introspective about what I want in a job. Like a rock skipping across a river, I've dipped into and out of development for the last 15 years. I've worked at a variety of companies from small to large, consumer products to enterprise software. Now I think I have a pretty good idea of the kind of environment I thrive in.
